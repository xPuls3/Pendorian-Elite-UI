Changes a large portion of Pendoria's text and UI to 'Elite' blue and makes small changes to the UI.

Every last feature can be toggled, including the recolor!

## Installation
* First, download [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/).
* Then go to the Downloads section above, and click the download link.
* Violentmonkey will display a "confirm Installation" button, confirm the installation.
* Afterwards refresh Pendoria.

## Notice
This script can be weird at times when used on Chrome, though easily fixed Puls3 doesn't use Chrome and as such doesn't notice them, remember to report any bugs you find!

If you have any issues using Violentmonkey's 'check for updates' feature and have been using the script since it was on Greasyfork, then uninstall then reinstall directly from GitHub.

A Lot of features are disabled by default, I suggest looking through them for settings you might like.

Given that Puls3 is a tester, most features (without being given away) will be made compatible with this script before their release on the live server.

## Support
This script is was created for Firefox, not Chrome, Chrome support relies on users reporting errors.

This script was made for Violentmonkey though may work on other extensions, if you use Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey, I suggest switching, though it's not required.
