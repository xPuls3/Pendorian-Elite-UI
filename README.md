# Pendorian Elite UI
Changes a large portion of Pendoria's text and UI to 'Elite' blue and makes small changes to the UI.

Every last feature can be customized or disabled, including the recolor!

A Lot of features are disabled by default, I suggest looking through them for settings you might like.

## Notice
Given that Puls3 is a tester and active on the development server, new features will most likely be made compatable before they arrive on the live game.

If you have any issues using Violentmonkey's 'check for updates' feature and have been using the script since it was on Greasyfork, then uninstall then reinstall directly from GitHub.

## Support
This script is was created for Firefox and only Firefox, not Chrome, not Opera, and not Vivaldi, alternate browser support relies on users reporting errors.

I'm at a dilema when it comes to browsers, for now Firefox remains the official standard, though it might switch to Chrome.

This script was made for Violentmonkey, though may work on other extensions, if you use Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey, I suggest switching, though it's not required. Greasemonkey users beware, it is the cause of many compatability issues.

Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, & Safari, all experience native issues inside Pendoria, and are incapable of running correctly - No support is provided to either of them. If you use either you should look into alternatives.

No support is provided to older versions, only the latest releases, this includes older versions of browsers and extensions.

If you have any issues using Violentmonkey's 'check for updates' feature and have been using the script since it was on Greasyfork, then uninstall it, and reinstall directly from GitHub.
